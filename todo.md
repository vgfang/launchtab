### node
- a node has a header text and an optional emoji

### hotkeys

- we are using chord-based key strokes to activate links
- nodes can have a key stroke associated with it: 'ab'
  - links can have a key stroke associated with it: 'c'
  - if that link is to be activated and its in that node we need to type 'abc'

### todo list
- data validation for modal entries
- make ui not ugly

### bugs
- keychord fn need to fix ux with enter key and btns overlap
- drag and drop from larger node to smaller one glitches out the node width

### optional features

- trash bin for recovering links
- background image option
- better error messaging (not js alerts?)
