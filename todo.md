### node
- a node has a header text and an optional emoji

### hotkeys
- we are using chord-based key strokes to activate links
- nodes can have a key stroke associated with it: 'ab'
  - links can have a key stroke associated with it: 'c'
  - if that link is to be activated and its in that node we need to type 'abc'

### todo list
- data validation
- keychord functionality (and fix ux with enter key and btns)
- disable test loading and set up defaults properly
- chrome extension
- import/export json
- make ui not ugly

### bugs
- edit node info loads too slowly bad UX
- drag and drop from larger node to smaller one glitches out the node width 

### optional features
- trash bin for recovering links
- background image option
